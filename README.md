# Graduate Assistantship Project

While completing my masters program I completed a graduate assistantship for the fall and spring semesters. 
<br>

We were tasked with using sample student data to build the foundation for analyzing conditional admit students and predicting their sucess. In this project I learned the following:
- How to explore data, to find meaninful insights.
- Process data for a machine learning model.
- Train and test a model to see how effective it is at making predictions. 
- Deploy the model in a dashboard to the web using github pages.
